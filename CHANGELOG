## HISTORY

- v0.2.56
  - changed: `InvalidStrategy` is -1 now since we got untyped int overflow error in auto-gen code by stringer

- v0.2.53
  - improved code style, format, ...
  - to fore-prevent low-performance and large-memory usage when retrieve expanded fields from a very large struct, use `cms.ByOrdinal` instead default `cms.ByName`
  - added new strategy `cms.Flat` and field tag to identify a pointer should be shallow copy to target field,
    ```go
    package main
    type A struct {
        field1 *ComplexStruct `copy:",flat"`
    }
    ```
  - `evendeep` supports to go1.11 currently

### v0.2.51

- temporary build: fixing array/slice copying logic

### v0.2.50

- first public release

I had this plan many years, but the recent fresh work is started from 2022-02-17, it's called as `evendeep` and get its first release finally.
